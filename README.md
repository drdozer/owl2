# owl2
A scala OWL2 API

This project provides an abstract API and concrete AST for the OWL2 specification.

## Future features

# Integration with banana-rdf, to support interoperability with RDF and re-use of shared data types.
# IO: Support for reading/writing OWL/XML, RDF and functional syntax.
# Profiles: OWL2 provides multiple profiles, and this API will expose each of these in a type-safe manner.
# Symbolic Syntax: Optionally enable a mathematical DSL for constructing ontologies.
# Cross-compiliation with scala-js, to provide web-browser support for rich ontologies.
